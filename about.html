                <div class="about-content-text">
                    <p>I have always been interested in applying technology to real life, whether it is solving a
                        real-world
                        problem, helping a friend, or to have fun (like video editting or building fun projects!).</p>

                    <p>Originally from Indonesia, I went to the University of Tasmania (Australia) to pursue further
                        study
                        in Computer Science. It is also the place where I have made countless memories and skills, which
                        is
                        also when I got introduced to programming (both challenging and fun at the same time)! I also
                        developed numerous skills and interests, especially in the area of software development (web and
                        mobile application) and AI.</p>
                    <p>Outside of studies and developing (fun) projects, I can be found watching YouTube
                        or
                        browsing the Internet to learn interesting things (like languages or random facts) or watching
                        YouTube tutorials on how to play my favourite songs on guitar. I am always eager to help
                        wherever I
                        can, especially in the digital world. I believe today is an opportunity for us to improve the
                        world
                        through technology, let's connect and keep in touch!</p>
